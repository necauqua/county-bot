## County Bot
This bot knows how to count!

Simply type `@countybot` in any chat to use it.

First it was my little toy project to play with Telegram Bot API, but then i've stripped off the nifty Python API that i made as a result into separate Python lib called [tinybot](https://github.com/necauqua/tinybot).
